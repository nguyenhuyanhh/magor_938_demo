\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}



\section{Objective}

The primary objective of this project is to develop a system capable of performing the following tasks on audio and video files:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Transcription of individual audio files, using both Google and in-house LVCSR systems
    \item Transcription of multi-channel audio recording
    \item Caption generation for video scenes
\end{itemize}

The developed system must be modular and extensible to other related tasks in audio and video processing; it must also encompass the following requirements and functionalities:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Robustness -- allowing system error recovery and process resumption
    \item Versioning -- allowing for different results with different processing components, and enabling evaluation of different components
    \item Logging and Reporting -- allowing developers to understand and generate insights to the outputs
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope}

The scope of the project is restricted to developing a system to be used in a desktop/ laptop Ubuntu Linux environment, to perform the tasks mentioned above. A functioning graphics user interface (GUI) is also not required.

However, the system could be modified and extended to perform other related tasks in different environments, with a GUI.

\section{Project Timeline}

The project was scheduled to commence from January 2017 to October 2017. The major milestones are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{End of January 2017:} Completion of Architectural Design
    \item \textbf{End of April 2017:} Completion of Porting of Existing Modules to Current System
    \item \textbf{End of September 2017:} Completion of Development of New Modules; Commencement of Integration Testing
    \item \textbf{End of October 2017:} Completion of Project
\end{itemize}
